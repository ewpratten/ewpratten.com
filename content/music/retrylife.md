**RetryLife** (previously known as **RetRY Life Music**) was a Canadian electronic music collective based in London, Ontario, Canada. Founded mid-2015 by [Evan Pratten](https://va3zza.com) and [Nathan Desjardins](https://www.artstation.com/kondroel), the group was dedicated to publication and distribution of experimental Electronic dance music produced by a small group of local friends who struggled to find their own platforms.

RetryLife distributed music via their Bandcamp webpage as well as a now-defunct YouTube channel showcasing songs with short music videos and audio visualizations.

## Collaborations

RetryLife twice collaborated with [Lester B. Pearson School for the Arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_B._Pearson_School_for_the_Arts) to compose and produce music for various shows put on by the school's students. These collaborations include two orchestral pieces, "Lightining" and "Superspark", composed by Evan, along with a full-length theatrical soundtrack for the 2017 student-directed show: "Imagined".

Near RetryLife's time of founding, Evan and Nathan also participated in an initiative to bring live orchestral samples into the game [Warframe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warframe) as a collaboration between Lester B. Pearson SFTA and [Big Blue Bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Blue_Bubble).

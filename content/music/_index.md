I have been a musician for most of my life, starting with the piano when I was 5, and progressing to drums and double bass a few years later.

I was originally in to (and performed) rock music, but found myself moving towards heavier metal, and eventually electronic dance music. Alongside this progression, I was also a part of an orchestra and a choir for a few years. Now, I find myself doing everything electronically.

## Self-released music

Since 2022 I have been publishing personal music projects of all kinds under my own name.

I've also produced the soundtrack for the short film [**Raindrops**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqzLxaQ3abM) by Emilia Frias.

## Music released as RetryLife

Spanning 2015 to 2017, I was a part of an electronic music group named RetryLife. Our music was largely experimental. I was the primary producer, and also handled public facing things like website management, video production, and social media.

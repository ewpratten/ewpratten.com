We are here.

<img src="/images/posts/pid/here.svg" style="margin: 2em auto;" />

And we want to go there.

## Figuring out how to get there

The first step in getting from *here* to *there* is knowing where *there* *isn't*.

I suppose a good place to start is checking to see if *here* and *there* are in fact the same place.

Are we there?

<img src="/images/posts/pid/are_we_there.svg" style="margin: 2em auto;" />

*Nope.*

Well, let's say we want to go *there* from *here* (because we do).. Which way do we have to go?

<img src="/images/posts/pid/this_way.svg" style="margin: 2em auto;" />

I think we can do that. How far will we have to travel?

Great!

## Getting there

So,  we know where we are, we know where we aren't, and we know the distance and direction we'll have to travel. What's next?

Unfortunately, as the answer tends to be, physics is next.

We can't exactly just *go* there. We have to *get* there. And that means we have to spend some time 'twixt *here* and *there*.

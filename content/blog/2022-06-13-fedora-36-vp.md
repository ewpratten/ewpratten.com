  excerpt: A quick guide on launching Visual Paradigm on Fedora 36
---

When installing [Visual Paradigm](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/) on my Fedora workstation today, I kept running into a `SIGSEGV` error, causing the bundled JVM to crash.

This issue was specifically starting at a function call to `hb_font_get_font_v_extents_default` in `libharfbuzz`.

## The solution

To get VP to launch correctly:

- Download the `InstallFree` version of the program from your download source and extract it
- Download [Temurin JRE 11.0.15](https://github.com/adoptium/temurin11-binaries/releases/download/jdk-11.0.15%2B10/OpenJDK11U-jre_x64_linux_hotspot_11.0.15_10.tar.gz) and extract it
- Delete the `Visual_Paradigm_<version>/jre` directory from the VP installer
- Replace that JRE directory with the contents of the Temurin JRE package (renaming the folder to `jre`)
- Launch, and ignore the warnings

## Why does this post exist?

~~SEO?~~ I will probably run in to this issue again a few more times, so why not write it down instead of digging through a [crash report](https://forums.visual-paradigm.com/t/visual-paradigm-crashes-on-fedora-36/17562/5) from the second page of google.

..and ya. SEO. Lots of juicy keywords are to be had in this document :wink:

After getting myself in to the world of customized mechanical keyboards with my [vortex core](@/blog/2020-11-06-Vortex-Core.md) two years ago, I have proceeded to dive further into the hobby by [modifying keyboard firmware](@/blog/2021-03-14-QMK-Vortex-Core.md) and eventually building myself a TG4X for daily use. The TG4X has been a great keyboard, and my muscle memory has completely switched over to the quirks of using a 40% layout in daily use. 

<!-- Of course, I shall not settle for a whole 45 keys on my keyboard, **we must go smaller!**. Thus, I have built my very own customised [ferris sweep](#) -->

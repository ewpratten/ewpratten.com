  excerpt: A look at the usage of personal ASNs based on freely available data
---

As a [network operator](/network), I keep a fairly close eye on what my peers are up to. This is mainly to make sure nobody is doing something *too* stupid near my network, but also just out of curiosity. Its nice to know what other people are up to, both as a sanity check on my own network, and as a view into new things I could try out.

I was recently inspired by [Hurricane Electric](https://he.net/)'s webpage that provides [statistics on IPv6 adoption](https://bgp.he.net/ipv6-progress-report.cgi) to create a website to display info about personal [Autonomous System Numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_(Internet)). This site both caught my interest due to being a pretty raw plain-text website (can you tell, I like simple webpages?), and due to containing a ton of interesting information.

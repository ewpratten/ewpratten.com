From the **London Free Press**:

> An appeal is going out to the Keystone state after a London high school class found out weather balloons can get away on you.
>
> Theirs — part of a high-flying experiment they thought would travel about 100 kilometres, 150 km tops — drifted twice as far, crossing the Canada-U.S. border and coming down in a mountain valley in Pennsylvania, 300 kilometres away.

Once found on the American side of the border, a corresponding article was written by the **Potter Leader-Enterprise**:

> At the school, principal Tracy Kio and fourth-grade science teacher Robert Raudenbush learned more about the balloon’s origins.
>
> They had found that the balloon was part an experiment, launched more than a week ago from a football field in London, Ontario, Canada,  by H.B. Beal Secondary school teacher Dung Tiet and 10 eager ninth-graders.

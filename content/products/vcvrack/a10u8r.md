**A10U8R** is a [2 HP](https://doepfer.de/a100_man/a100m_e.htm) *(10.16mm)* attenuator module for [VCV Rack 2](https://vcvrack.com/), inspired by a real life version of the same thing I worked on for my grandfather.

This module features one input, one output, and a nob that multiplies the input voltage by a range from $0$ to $1$. Nothing fancy.

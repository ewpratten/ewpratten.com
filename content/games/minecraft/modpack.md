title: My Minecraft Modpack
---

For the past handful of years, I've been maintaining a personal collection of Minecraft mods that improve upon base gameplay and optimize the game's internals.

## Installation

This modpack is distributed in `.mrpack` format. To use it, you'll need to install the [**Prism Launcher**](https://prismlauncher.org/).

Once installed:

1. Head to **Add Instance** in the top-left corner of the application
2. Select **Import**
3. Choose one of the files from the *Releases* section below

## Releases

{% note(type="note") %}
Unless you really know what you are doing, pick the <strong>latest version</strong>.
<br>
All modpack versions can play on <em>any</em> server version.
{% end %}

<div style="padding:0 1em; border: 1px solid #d7dde3; border-radius: 5px;margin-bottom: 1em; background-color: #f0feff;">
<h3>Minecraft Java Edition 1.21.1</h3>

- [Evan's Pack **1.21.1r1**](https://ewpratten.com/download/minecraft-modpack/1.21.1r1) ***(latest)***

</div>

<details style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><summary><h3>Older Versions</h3></summary>
<div style="padding: 1em; padding-bottom: 0;">

These older modpack versions are provided if you are looking to run a specific version of Minecraft.

Remember: **all modpack versions can play on any server version**. You do not need to match the modpack version with the server version like you would with a vanilla client.

Minecraft is one of my all-time favourite video games. I've been playing since the 1.2.x days, enjoying my fair share of creative redstone tinkering, lightly modded servers *(RIP MCCTF)*, and multiplayer survival shenanigans with friends.

## My Mods & Plugins

I like modifying Minecraft almost as much as I enjoy playing it. The following are some of my more-recent mods:

- [Client Ping](@/games/minecraft/modding/client-ping.md): Client-side Point-of-Interest marking
- [Illuminated Shields](@/games/minecraft/modding/illuminated-shields.md): Shields that emit light
- [FrostBucket](@/games/minecraft/modding/frost-bucket.md): Apply `Frost Walker` to your buckets

I also maintain a modpack that contains everything I consider "must-have" when playing. Any time I'm playing Minecraft, it can be assumed that I'm using my trusty quality-of-life pack. 

Want to try my take on the game? Check out [Evan's Pack](https://modrinth.com/modpack/ewpratten) on Modrinth, or in your favourite Modrinth-compatible launcher (Prism, MultiMC, etc..).

Back in 2017, I took a school-organized trip around Québec. My friends and I brought our cameras, loaded up on SD cards, and went all out with some pretty creative shots.

While I was mainly focused on shooting video, I did take a few hundred photos along the way, and later edited them all to fit a sort of rough grainy theme I was playing around with at the time.

I am quite fond of this one, a super wide shot made from stitching a bunch of photos together in [Microsoft ICE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_Composite_Editor).

I also took a bunch of neat waterfall photos:

# Amateur Radio

I have been an amateur radio operator since 2020, and an electronics enthusiast since long before then.

## VA3ZZA

**VA3ZZA** is my primary callsign. If you hear me calling CQ, come say hi!

I generally operate:

- 7.030 MHz CW
- 2M & 70CM FM
- APRS

## VA3UJF

**VA3UJF** is my secondary callsign.

If you see/hear this callsign on-air, its probably tied to some automated system. Check back to this page to see if I have any on-going project you can interact with.

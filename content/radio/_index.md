# Amateur Radio

I have been an amateur radio operator since 2020, and an electronics enthusiast since long before then.

## VA3ZZA

**VA3ZZA** is my primary callsign. If you hear me calling CQ, come say hi!

I generally operate:

- 7.030 MHz CW
- 2M & 70CM FM
- APRS

## VA3UJF

**VA3UJF** is my secondary callsign. I use it to separate some of my projects from my primary callsign.

Currently, you may find VA3UJF:

- [Injecting Canadian passenger train telemetry into the APRS network](https://github.com/ewpratten/aprs-trains/)
- [Acting as a repeater linking hub](/radio/va3ujf-hub)

## Reviews

> I love the mood of this game. As you get deeper and deeper, you tend to forget that you have to breathe. But… the game does remind you, or at least it reminds your clone. I love the feel of just moving around in the ocean. - [MrTroy](https://ldjam.com/users/mrtroy)

> I loved your pixel art. I had fun collecting my fishes and it was beautiful having them around me when i was going deeper and deeper. Until i die. But overall, it’s a great game - [RedSorel](https://ldjam.com/users/redsorel)

> Nice game! The gameplay works well, simple and efficient, the graphic and sound mood work well together. - [Khelian](https://ldjam.com/users/khelian)

## About me

By day I am a **software developer**, working on the tooling that powers children's TV productions at [Industrial Brothers](https://www.industrialbrothers.com/).
Perviously worked with [Raider Robotics](https://www.raiderrobotics.org/), building high-performance robotic control system software.

By night I am *"indecisive about my hobbies"*. I bounce around between a large collection of interests, with the common focus of wanting to learn how things *really work*. I take deep dives into topics that I find interesting, and occasionally write about them [on my blog](/blog).

## Whats in the works

- Practicing my morse code skills on-air as [VA3ZZA](https://www.qrz.com/db/va3zza)

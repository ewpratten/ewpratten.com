## About me 

Hey, I'm Evan! I'm a software developer by day, and indecisive about my hobbies by night. 

I like to learn new things, and build up my arsenal of unusual skills. Everything I do revolves around making use of cutting-edge technology to solve problems. This website is the home to everything I'm up to, feel free to look around!

<!-- I love to experiment with little-used technologies, and specialize in *making things interconnect*. -->

<!-- I am a first-year college student, studying Software Engineering at Sheridan College. I develop software both as a hobby, and professionally, and have been programming since I was in the 5th grade. I am also a Canadian amateur radio operator (callsign **VA3ZZA**), and the former Lead Software Developer at [Raider Robotics](https://github.com/frc5024). -->

<br>

As always, I'm working on multiple projects at the same time and have my head crammed full of technobabble. Currently, I am:

- Working on the graphics pipeline powering children's TV productions at [Industrial Brothers](https://www.industrialbrothers.com/)
- Operating [AS398057](https://net.va3zza.com), providing internet backbone services.
- Contributing to the Rust library and tooling ecosystem over on [GitHub](https://github.com/ewpratten)

<!-- ## Experience

- **Technical Consultant**, [Personal Computers of London](http://pcol.ca)
- **Co-Founder**, [RetryLife](/music/retrylife) -->

## The less technical

Occasionally I like to spend some time doing something that doesn't involve programming.

I've been a musician since a very young age, and still continue my musical experimentation (albeit to a lesser degree) in my free time. I generally focus on integrating various samples into new genres, and like to produce tracks that float somewhere between dubstep and lofi. Check out [my music page](/music) for more info.

I also enjoy shooting and editing photos. I almost exclusively shoot with just a phone camera, and like playing around with various bits of software for the finishing touches. Check out my photography and 3D rendering work [on my Instagram page](https://instagram.com/evanpratten).


## Featured Projects

<div class="project">
<h3>AS398057</h3>

AS398057 (formerly AS204466) is my personal network, powering many of my projects. I cover all aspects of network operation myself, from playing [NOC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_operations_center) to getting my hands dirty with hand-crafted router configs.

<div class="project">
<h3>Rust libraries</h3> 

I develop and maintain many Rust libraries. Some are end products, but many are developed out of necessity for other projects of mine. I see a strong future in the Rust programming language, and it has become my language of choice in personal projects.

- [Published libraries](https://crates.io/users/Ewpratten?sort=downloads)
- [All Rust projects](https://github.com/search?o=desc&p=1&q=user%3AEwpratten+language%3ARust&s=stars&type=Repositories)

<div class="project">
<h3>The Ludum Dare game jam</h3>

Every half-year, I set aside some time to participate in [Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com/). The following are the *finished* games I have worked on as a part of the event:

- [\[data::loss\]](https://github.com/Ewpratten/ludum-dare-49)
- [Deep Breath](https://github.com/Ewpratten/ludum-dare-48)
- [Micromanaged Mike](https://rsninja.dev/LudumDare46/)

<div class="project">
<h3>Robotics</h3>

From 2017 to 2021, I was the Lead Software Developer at [Raider Robotics](https://raiderrobotics.org), a competitive robotics team. I handled most aspects of core software development and subteam management. Some of the biggest projects I lead during my time with the team were:

- [Lib5K](https://github.com/frc5024/lib5k), the core control and mathematics library for the team
- [Darth Raider](https://github.com/frc5024/InfiniteRecharge), a highly integrated robot with fully-autonomous navigation and control
- [HATCHField](https://github.com/frc5024/DeepSpace), a robot with experimental on-the-fly path planning capabilities
- [Q*bert](https://github.com/frc5024/powerup), a robot that integrated my first ever computer-vision-assisted aiming system

<h3>OpenDepthMap</h3>

OpenDepthMap was an experiment in [Binocular Depth Mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binocular_disparity), based around the [ultraleap](https://www.ultraleap.com/)'s first generation [LeapMotion](https://www.ultraleap.com/product/leap-motion-controller/) hand tracking sensors.

The end product of this project was a tool to generate reasonably accurate depth maps in real-time from a single LeapMotion camera.

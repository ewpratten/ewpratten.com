## About Me

By day I am a software developer, working on the tooling that powers children's TV productions at [Industrial Brothers](https://www.industrialbrothers.com). Perviously worked with [Raider Robotics](https://raiderrobotics.org), building high-performance robotic control system software.

By night I am *"indecisive about my hobbies"*. I bounce around between a large collection of interests, with the common focus of wanting to learn how things *really* work. I take deep dives into topics that I find interesting, and occasionally write about them on [my blog](/blog).


## Whats in the Works
I am currently working on a few projects, including:

- Maintaining [AS54041](https://peeringdb.com/asn/54041), a small computer network
- Publishing music under my own name on <a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/1aLNEmgqBJkhfkEZvf8Vh5" rel="me">Spotify</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://music.apple.com/us/artist/evan-pratten/1611566708" rel="me">Apple Music</a>
- Maintaining a handful of [Open-Source software tools](/projects)
- Occasionally publishing interesting <a target="_blank" href="https://instagram.com/ewpratten" rel="me">photos and artwork</a>

I am also working on an Internet-Draft:

- [draft-evan-amateur-radio-ipv6](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-evan-amateur-radio-ipv6) - Globally Unique IPv6 Addressing for Amateur Radio

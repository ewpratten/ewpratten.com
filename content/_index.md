<!-- ## About me

By day I am a <strong>Pipeline Software Developer</strong> at Toronto-based animation studio
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.industrialbrothers.com">Industrial Brothers</a>
where I build backend tooling that helps streamline the process from concept to final render
for our productions. The most recent of which: *Daniel Spellbound* is now streaming on Netflix.

By night I am *"indecisive about my hobbies"*. I bounce around between a large collection of interests, with the common focus of wanting to learn how things *really work*. I take deep dives into topics that I find interesting, and occasionally write about them on [my blog](/blog).

## Whats in the works

I am currently working on a few projects, including:

- Maintaining [AS54041](https://as54041.peeringdb.com), a small computer network
- Publishing music under my own name on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1aLNEmgqBJkhfkEZvf8Vh5) and [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/evan-pratten/1611566708)
- Occasional <a href="https://instagram.com/evanpratten" target="_blank" rel="me">photography</a>

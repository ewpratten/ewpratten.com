## About me

By day I am a **software developer**, working on the tooling that powers children's TV productions at [Industrial Brothers](https://www.industrialbrothers.com/).
Perviously worked with [Raider Robotics](https://www.raiderrobotics.org/), building high-performance robotic control system software.

By night I am *"indecisive about my hobbies"*. I bounce around between a large collection of interests, with the common focus of wanting to learn how things *really work*. I take deep dives into topics that I find interesting, and occasionally write about them on this site.

## Whats in the works

I am currently working on a few projects, including:

- Maintaining [AS54041](https://as54041.peeringdb.com), a small computer network
- Publishing music under my own name on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1aLNEmgqBJkhfkEZvf8Vh5) and [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/evan-pratten/1611566708)

I am also working on an Internet-Draft:

- [draft-evan-amateur-radio-ipv6](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-evan-amateur-radio-ipv6) - Globally Unique IPv6 Addressing for Amateur Radio

I tend to spend more time modifying Minecraft than I do actually playing the game. Most of the projects in this section were commissioned by friends.

FrostBucket is a server-side Minecraft plugin that adds a new item, the Frost Bucket. This item turns water into ice. The FrostBucket plugin does not have any intentional practical use, but just exists to satisfy a concept brought up on a late-night Discord call: *"What if you could put Frost Walker on a bucket?"*

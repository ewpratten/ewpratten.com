title: 3D Printing

You know how people tell you not to come up with solutions in search of a problem?

Well, I completely throw that advice out the window when I can get my hands on a 3D printer. It's just too much fun to design and print random little things.

This page is dedicated to sharing my designs in case they some-day help someone else.

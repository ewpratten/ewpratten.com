Minecraft has been my go-to game for most of my life, being roughly the third video game I ever played. 

I recall first learning about it on the school playground in second or third grade (yes, really). Some time later, I eventually got my own copy of the game, and dove straight in to the world of voxels, questionable [GI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_illumination), and the quirks of the Java runtime.

I started playing some time in the 1.2.x era (.3? .4?), and as such am quite attached to the "old Minecraft".

# VFX and Animation

I work in the animation industry, and as such some of the ideas I am unable to implement at work make their way into personal projects.

This project aims to build an easy to use Docker container that contains everything needed for me to experiment with Pixar's [Universal Scene Description (USD)](http://openusd.org/) in a safe and reproducible environment.

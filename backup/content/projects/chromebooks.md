title: "Projects: Chromebook Hacking"
---

In the early days of Chromebooks, I was an active member of the os and firmware hacking scene. I have long since moved on from development on Chomebooks, but a few old projects still stand.

When I was working on these projects, the Chromium team had not opened up the ability to launch Linux applications to the public yet, so we would put our devices in developer mode, and work around the tight security sandbox manually.

title: Morse Keys

This page is dedicated to the weird things I've used as morse code keys.

## My practice key

I built this back in 2018, and used it to learn how to send morse code over the course of a few weeks.

Key features are:

- A key made from a paperclip and some aluminium foil
- A volume adjustment knob
- A buzzer to make a sound when the key is pressed

I later ended up modifying it to use two paperclips and wrote some software to turn it into an iambic keyer.

Another variation of this existed for portable use. I also wrote out a little morse code cheat sheet on the back incase I got stuck on something while practicing.

## Paperclip straight key

Inspired by my practice key, I've occasionally used paperclips as straight keys into my HF radio.

## PCIe key

Back when my only HF radio was a [Pixie QRP kit](/radio/pixie), I built a simple straight key out of a PCIe slot cover.

A little while later, I redesigned this key to use some scrap wood as its base. I still occasionally this key, but I find the metal-on-metal clacking sound it makes to be a little annoying.

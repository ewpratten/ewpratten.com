<p>
    I have been a musician for most of my life, starting with the piano when I was 5, and progressing to drums and
    double bass a few years later.
</p>
<p>
    I was originally in to (and performed) rock music, but found myself moving towards heavier metal, and eventually
    electronic dance music. Alongside this progression, I was also a part of an orchestra and a choir for a few years.
    Now, I find myself doing everything electronically.

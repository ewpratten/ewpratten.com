**Darth Raider** was a 4-foot-tall 120lb robot that myself and a group of friends designed, built, and programmed at [*Raider Robotics*](https://raiderrobotics.org/?utm_source=ewpratten.com){:target="_blank"} back in 2020. I personally lead software development for the project, and also played a key part in guiding the physical design of the robot.

**Darth Raider** carried a 15-4-0 WLT record, and was ranked #1 at the *FIRST Robotics Humber College ONT District Event*. This success ranked Raider Robotics as the 8th best robotics team in all of Canada for the 2020 competition season.

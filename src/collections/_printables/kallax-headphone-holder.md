title: KALLAX headphone holder
---

IKEA's KALLAX shelf has some holes drilled in it that are intended to be used for wall mounting with a 90-degree bracket. I use my shelves sideways, so wall mounting isn't really important for stability.

This leaves me with some unused mounting holes. I decided to design a headphone holder that attaches to these holes instead.

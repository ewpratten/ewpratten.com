title: Cable organizing clips for VIVO monitor arms
---

Ever looking for a monitor arm? I always recommend the VIVO arms from Amazon. They do a great job and are pretty cheap.

They come with a few black plastic clips that can be used to keep your cables tidy. I personally found myself wanting a few extras, so I ended up designing my own.

Feel free to [download the STL file](/assets/printables/vivo-monitor-arm-clips/vivo-monitor-arm-clips.stl) and print your own.

My very first introduction to robotics was back in 2014, when I took an autonomous programming workshop as a part of a bigger summer engineering event at [Western University](https://www.uwo.ca/). A few years later, I ended up beginning a stint of robotics work through two different competitive robotics teams.

## Elementary school robotics

Back in 2016, myself and three other friends formed a competitive robotics team at our elementary school called the *Star Trekies*. My role on the team was both hardware prototyping and single-handedly programming the entire robot.

With very little knowledge of what we were doing, we stumbled our way through the process, and realistically got pretty much nowhere. Importantly though, I ended up figuring out a few key concepts of control systems development in the process that would come in handy later on.

## Highschool robotics

When presented with the question of which highschool I would apply to at the end of 8th grade, I specifically chose *H.B. Beal Secondary School* due to their well-known competitive robotics team, [Raider Robotics](https://www.raiderrobotics.org/), which later turned into a special-invite full-credit program at the school (conveniently counting towards my college requirements).

The year before I joined Raider Robotics, most of the members with substantial technical knowledge moved on to other schools, leaving me once again will very little to work off of.

### Introduction

I remember in mid December of 2017, this testbed was brought in to the software lab I was working in, thus marking my first hands-on experience with a fully programable machine at this level.

I don't remember a ton about that night, aside from a group of confused students trying to figure out how to load code onto the thing, and [@hyperliskdev](https://github.com/hyperliskdev) teaching me how to make a `class` in Python3 (its the weirdest things that stick in my memory..)

Fast-forward a few months to early February 2018, and I had figure out how to control a newly built testbed with a laptop sending control commands over a WLAN connection.

Illuminated Shields is a Minecraft resource pack that hooks in to the [LambDynamicLights](https://modrinth.com/mod/lambdynamiclights) mod to cause shields to emit light.

I made this resource pack by request. It was requested as a way to remove the need to carry a torch in the off-hand to see better at night. Instead, you can just carry your shield like normal, and use its light-emitting properties to find your way through the world.

The light emission of shields works in multiplayer environments, allowing your friends to guide you through the night with their shields too.

Truly put your multitasking skills to the test as you help Mike do daily tasks, hard parts is, Mike doesn’t have any autonomous body functions. You have to do everything for him, even making him blink.

## Reviews

> This is one of the best games i played in this LD, it’s very fun, and even with complex mechanics that tend to be really hard, the learning curve is good. - [BoarGames](https://ldjam.com/users/boargames){:target="_blank"}

> Funny game, defenitely 5 stars for humor fun and mood, well done! - [TeiNRee](https://ldjam.com/users/teinree){:target="_blank"}

> Hilarious and aggravating at the same time …good graphics and a fitting little tune that gets increasingly irritating as you go on (that’s probably intended). The music kinda reminded me of Pat&Mat stop motion animations that I watched as a kid. - [Tomssuli](https://ldjam.com/users/tomssuli){:target="_blank"}

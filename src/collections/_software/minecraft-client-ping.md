Client Ping is a Minecraft ([`^1.19.4`](https://jubianchi.github.io/semver-check/#/constraint/^1.19.4)) mod I wrote that implements multiplayer Point-of-Interest marking without the need for a server-side plugin/mod counterpart.

## Usage

Client Ping binds itself to the <kbd>Z</kbd> key by default. Press it while in any world, and a message will be sent to chat.

Players *without* the mod will see the coordinates you've pinged in their chat, and players *with* the mod will also see the ping marked in their world.

Due to the fact this mod uses server chat, you can use it to share coordinates with vanilla players, something I find quite handy.

## Get Client Ping

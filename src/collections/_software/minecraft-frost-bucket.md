FrostBucket is a server-side plugin I built for for Minecraft [`~1.16.0`](https://jubianchi.github.io/semver-check/#/constraint/~1.16.0) that allows players to apply the `Frost Walker` enchantment to a bucket.

Buckets with `Frost Walker` applied are able to pick up water like a regular bucket, but place ice instead of water when emptied.

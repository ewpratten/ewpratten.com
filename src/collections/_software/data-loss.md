**[data::loss]** is a fast-paced side-scroller platforming game where you navigate a world full of graphical inconsistencies that have a habit of causing physical consequences.

The game was built by myself and a collection of friends during my first year of college. The whole game was created in just 72 hours by a team that had never worked together before. For many of the members, this was their first time building a game!

## Reviews

> Why would you make this game? Why would you do this to another person? Not everyone chose violence for this game jam. There was a game about a kobold making inventions out of junk to buy a nice rock. There was a physics game about mixing colored beads to make new colors. I saved some pirates from a dragon and some parrots in one game. This game took all my ideas of space and time and called them cringe. I don’t know what pit of hell you came from, but I hope you’re happy. 10/10. - [DragonSheep](https://ldjam.com/users/dragonsheep){:target="_blank"}

> ... Overall this is a great game, the art and music is awesome, and there’s a good dose of humor and sass to the game. Awesome job!! - [lukeoco1234](https://ldjam.com/users/lukeoco1234){:target="_blank"}

> Great game, really liked the aesthetic, it takes what would be an already cool reflex based autorun game and enhances is it with unique challenges in the levels. - [AidanV03](https://ldjam.com/users/aidanv03){:target="_blank"}

Recently, I have been on a bit of a mission to improve my school workflow with software. Over the past month, I have built a cleaner [student portal](https://github.com/Ewpratten/student_portal#unofficial-tvdsb-student-portal-webapp){:target="_blank"} for my school and [written a tool](https://github.com/Ewpratten/timeandplace-api#timeandplace-api--cli-application){:target="_blank"} for automating in-class attendance. Alongside working on these projects, I have also been refining my notetaking system for school.

Since 9th grade, I have been taking notes in a private GitHub repository in markdown, and have been compiling them to HTML using a makefile for each course. While this system has worked ok, It has been far from perfect. Recently, I have been working very hard to give this system a much-needed upgrade. Here is the new tech stack:

 - The [Bazel buildsystem](https://bazel.build){:target="_blank"}
 - [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown){:target="_blank"}
 - [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX){:target="_blank"}
 - [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/){:target="_blank"}
 - [Beamer](https://ctan.org/pkg/beamer){:target="_blank"}
 - [Tikz & PGF](https://ctan.org/pkg/pgf){:target="_blank"}
 - [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/){:target="_blank"}
 - [Zathura](https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/){:target="_blank"}
 - [Starlark](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/language.html){:target="_blank"}
 - [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions){:target="_blank"} CI

The idea is that every course I take becomes its own Bazel package, with subpackages for things like assignments, papers, notes, and presentations. I can compile everything just by running the command `bazel build //:all`. All builds are cached using Bazel's build caching system, so when I run the command to compile my notes (I love saying that), I only end up compiling things that have changed since the last run. The setup for all of this is quite simple. All that is really needed is a Bazel workspace with the [`bazel_pandoc`](https://github.com/ProdriveTechnologies/bazel-pandoc){:target="_blank"} rules loaded (although I have opted to use some custom [genrules](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/be/general.html#genrule){:target="_blank"} instead). Using these rules, markdown files can be concatenated, and compiled into a PDF. I also use a modified version of the [Eisvogel](https://github.com/Wandmalfarbe/pandoc-latex-template){:target="_blank"} Pandoc template to make all my documents look a little neater.

In terms of workflow, I write all my notes as markdown files with [embedded LaTeX](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#math){:target="_blank"} for any equations and charts I may need. All of this is done inside of VSCode, and I have a custom `tasks.json` file that lets me press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>b</kbd> to re-compile whatever I am currently working on. I also keep Zathura open in a window to the side for a nearly-live preview system.

Now, the question came up of *"how do you easily distribute notes and assignments to classmates and professors?"*. That question got me stuck for a while, but here is the system I have come up with:

 1. I write an assignment
 2. I push it to the private GitHub repository
 3. GitHub Actions picks up the deployment with a custom build script
 4. Every document is built into a PDF, and packaged with a directory listing generated by [`tree -H`](http://mama.indstate.edu/users/ice/tree/tree.1.html#XML/JSON/HTML%20OPTIONS){:target="_blank"}
 5. Everything is pushed to a subdomain on my website via GitHub pages
 6. I can share documents via URL to anyone

This is almost entirely accomplished by a shell script and a custom CI script.

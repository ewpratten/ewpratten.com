A rather large number of people know me as "the guy who does weird things with python". I would object to this title, but it is quite accurate. So, here are some of the things I like playing with in python. None of these are actually breaking the language, just little known facts and syntax. At some point I will share about actually breaking the language. For now, enjoy the weird things I have found over the past 6 years.

## Type hints
A little known feature of python is called "type hinting" (PEP 484). This is actually quite common to see in standard libraries, and has it's own special syntax:
```python
# Here is a regular function
def meep(a, b):
    return a*b^2

# This function has no real reason to exsist, and is lacking any sort of documentation.
# Let's add a docstring to explain what it does

def meep(a, b):
    """ This function returns the result of a times b squared """
    return a*b^2

# Ok. The docstring explains the function, but is not too helpful 
# what are a and b? what does this return? 
# For all we know, a could actually be a string (in which case, this function would return a string)
# Let's fix that up with a type hint

def meep(a: int, b: int):
    """ This function returns the result of a times b squared """
    return a*b^2

# Thanks to the :int (called a type hint in case you didn't notice that yet), we now know that this function expects two ints.
# Now, to finish this up with a secondary type hint to specify the return type
def meep(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """ This function returns the result of a times b squared """
    return a*b^2

# There. Now we can clearly see that this function takes too ints, and returns one int. 
# If only this was a requirement in the language. So many headaches could be solved.
```

Now, keep in mind that this is called a type *hint*. The python compiler (yes.. Give me a second for that one) does not actually care if you obey the hint or not. Feel free to send incorrect data into a hinted function and see what you can break. Critical functions should both hint and check the data types being provided.

## Type declarations
Just like type hints for functions, python has hints for variables too.
```python
# A regular variable. Must be declared with an initial value
my_state = None

# my_state is None, as it has not been set, but needs to exist.
# Let's assume that my_state is to be a state:
class State:
    status = False
    def toggle(self):
        self.status != self.status

# Finally, its time to set the state to something useful
my_state = State()
my_state.toggle()

# Ok.. I hate this. Let's start by using type declarations first
# Any variable can be un-initialized and just have a type. Like so:
my_state: State

# This works for anything
is_alive: bool
age: int
name: str

# Now, with this new knowledge, let's rewrite State
class State:
    status: bool
    def toggle(self: State) -> None:
        self.status != self.status

# And initialize my_state with slightly different syntax
my_state = State(status=True)
```

I have not found much use for this yet. Hopefully there is something cool to use it for.

## One-line functions
This is more common knowlage. A function can be declared in one line
```python
# Here is an adder function
def adder1(a:int, b:int) -> int:
    return a+b

# Here is a one-line adder function
adder2 = lambda a,b : a+b

# State from above can be compacted further:
class State:
    status: bool
    toggle = lambda self: self.status != self.status
```

## Ternary operations
On the trend of one-line code, We have the one-line if/else, also known as a Ternary in more sensible languages.
```python
# Here is an if/else
if 100 is 5:
    print("The world has ended")
else:
    print("All is good")

# Here is a smaller if/else
print("The world has ended" if 100 is 5 else "All is good")
```

## Compiled python
This one is interesting. Python, like Java, is compiled into bytecode. So yes, it technically is a compiled language. To see said bytecode, take a look at any `.pyc` file sitting in your `__pycache__`

## Blog formatting experiments
I am still playing with post formats, and various types of content. This is more random than I usually prefer. Let me know your thoughts on the social media platform of your choosing.

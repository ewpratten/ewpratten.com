title: Virtual and Physical networks
---

I am very much a [homelabber](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/) except unlike most, my gear is spread across many physical locations around the world. To keep everything easily accessible, and securely interconnected, I have built and maintain a large virtual network.

With hosts spread across both the public internet, and in private networks behind extremely restrictive firewalls, I needed to build a secure and versatile virtual private networking setup to handle traffic routing and device connections.

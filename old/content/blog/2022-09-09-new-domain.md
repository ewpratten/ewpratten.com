  excerpt: A small update post about some website changes
---

Hello! Its been a bit since the last post made it out of the drafts (I promise, there are many in the works). I figure a little public update is needed to talk about some backend changes that have recently been made to this site.

Firstly, there is a new domain name! I should have done this a while ago, but now I actually own the domain for my username. Welcome to `ewpratten.com`. The past two domains used for this site (`retrylife.ca` and `va3zza.com`) still happily redirect here, so no need to worry about updating your bookmarks and hyperlinks yet.

Secondly, this site is now anycasted and edge cached. Hopefully this change will make the browsing experience a little faster for viewers outside of North America. [HTTP/3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/3) is now supported too. In the future, I might even set up some older protocols (Gopher, FTP, ..telnet..?) for fun. Info on that will come in a later post.

Anyways, thanks for reading. I'm always amazed to see my analytics data. A surprising number of people read these posts :smile:

Just like my [monitor arm clips](/3dprint/vivo-monitor-arm-clips/), I found myself wanting some cable organizing clips for my microphone arm.

I designed these to friction-fit my specific mic arm, but they will probably work on any arm with a similar diameter.

Feel free to [download the STL file](/downloads/cad/neewer-mic-arm-clips.stl) and print your own.
